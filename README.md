# Capstone_Project_Multilabel_Classification
Udacity - Data Scientist Nanodegree Program - Capstone Project

# Installation
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:
- NumPy 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Keras

You will also need to have a software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

The visualization file requires Power BI.

# Project
From sales predictions to automatic speech creation or image recognition, Data Science has an infinite number of applications in our society and will impact our lives drastically in many ways in the short and long term. Will it be for the best or the worst? Even the greatest specialists in Data Science and Artificial intelligence have opposite visions on what the future will be. It will mainly depend on how we decide to use it.  

For the final project of Data Scientist Nanodegree of Udacity, I choose to bet for the optimistic option by taking part in an online “Data for Good” competition, the “Mobile Money and Financial Inclusion in Tanzania Challenge” hosted by Zindi, an African Data Science platform. 

The report includes the description of the steps followed in the realization of the project, some visualization, the main insights extracted from the data, explanations on the modelling phase and the conclusions and reflections about the project. The detail of the code is available in the Jupyter Notebook
